## ‚úçÔ∏è Creating & Managing FAQs

### Q: How do I create a new FAQ?
**A:** 
1. Go to **FAQs** in your WordPress Admin
2. Click **Add New**
3. Enter your question as the **post title**
4. Enter your answer in the **post content** area (using the WordPress Editor)

### Q: Can I use the WordPress block editor for FAQ answers?

### Q: How do I organize my FAQs into categories?
**A:** The plugin supports WordPress taxonomies (categories) for FAQs. You can create categories and assign FAQs to them, then display all FAQs from a specific category using the category shortcode parameter.

## üîß Using Shortcodes

### Q: How do I display a single FAQ on my page?
**A:** Use the shortcode `[KISSFAQ post="XYZ" hidden="true"]` where:
- **XYZ** is the FAQ ID (shown when editing the FAQ)
- **hidden="true"** starts with the answer collapsed (recommended)
- **hidden="false"** starts with the answer expanded

### Q: How do I display all FAQs from a specific category?
**A:** Use the shortcode `[KISSFAQS category="cat_slug" exclude="123,456" hidden="true"]` where:
- **cat_slug** is your category slug
- **exclude** is optional - comma-separated post IDs to exclude
- **hidden** controls whether answers start collapsed or expanded

### Q: Can I exclude certain FAQs when displaying a category?
**A:** Yes! Use the `exclude` parameter in the shortcode with comma-separated FAQ IDs. For example: `[KISSFAQS category="general" exclude="827755,827756" hidden="true"]`

### Q: Do the FAQs work on mobile and all browsers?
**A:** Yes! The plugin includes Safari-friendly toggle functionality and is designed to work across all modern browsers and devices.

## üîç SEO & Schema

### Q: What is FAQ Schema and why does it matter?
**A:** FAQ Schema is structured data in JSON-LD format that helps search engines understand your FAQ content. It can lead to:
- Rich snippets in search results
- FAQ sections appearing directly in Google search
- Better visibility and higher click-through rates
- Improved SEO performance

### Q: How does the plugin implement FAQ Schema?
**A:** The plugin automatically adds FAQPage schema markup whenever you use the `[KISSFAQ]` shortcode. Each FAQ is treated as a `mainEntity` with the question and accepted answer properly formatted for search engines.

### Q: How can I verify my FAQ Schema is working?
**A:** 
1. Visit a page where you've added FAQ shortcodes
2. Use Google's **Rich Results Test** tool
3. Enter your page URL
4. Check that the tool detects your FAQ structured data
5. Review any warnings or suggestions

### Q: Will my FAQs definitely appear as rich snippets in Google?
**A:** While proper schema markup increases the likelihood, Google ultimately decides whether to display rich snippets based on many factors including content quality, relevance, and search intent. The plugin gives you the best technical foundation for rich results.

### Q: Can I control which FAQs appear in XML sitemaps?
**A:** Yes! Version 1.04.7+ includes comprehensive sitemap control features:
- **Individual Control:** Each FAQ has a "Sitemap Settings" metabox with "Publish to Sitemap" dropdown (Yes/No)
- **Global Control:** FAQ Settings page has "Publish All FAQ Posts to Sitemap" option
- **Smart Precedence:** Global setting overrides individual settings when disabled

### Q: Why would I want to exclude FAQs from sitemaps?
**A:** Excluding FAQs from sitemaps helps prevent SEO cannibalization. If you have many similar FAQs or test content, they might compete with your main pages in search results. Sitemap exclusion gives you granular control over which content search engines prioritize.

### Q: What happens when I exclude an FAQ from the sitemap?
**A:** Two things happen automatically:
1. **Sitemap Exclusion:** The FAQ won't appear in your XML sitemap files
2. **Noindex Tag:** The plugin adds `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />` to the FAQ page header, reinforcing that search engines shouldn't index it

### Q: How do the global and individual sitemap settings work together?
**A:** The global setting takes precedence:
- **Global ON + Individual YES:** FAQ appears in sitemap ‚úÖ
- **Global ON + Individual NO:** FAQ excluded from sitemap ‚ùå
- **Global OFF:** ALL FAQs excluded regardless of individual settings ‚ùå

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Configuration

### Q: Where do I find the FAQ settings page?
**A:** Go to **FAQs ‚Üí Settings** in your WordPress admin. The settings page includes layout options, sitemap controls, self-tests, and cleanup tools.

### Q: What layout options are available?
**A:** The plugin offers two layout styles:
- **Default Layout:** Traditional FAQ style with arrow icons
- **Sleuth AI Layout:** Modern style with + / - toggle buttons and clean borders

### Q: What are the self-tests and why should I run them?
**A:** The settings page includes four automated tests to validate functionality:
1. **Metabox Registration Test:** Ensures sitemap controls are properly registered
2. **Global Setting Override Test:** Validates global sitemap setting behavior
3. **Sitemap Exclusion Test:** Confirms sitemap filtering is working
4. **Noindex Tag Generation Test:** Verifies noindex meta tags are added correctly

These tests help catch issues after plugin updates or configuration changes.

### Q: What is the test FAQ cleanup feature?
**A:** The cleanup tool automatically detects FAQ posts that appear to be test content (containing words like "test," "sample," "demo," etc.) and allows you to safely delete them with one click. This helps maintain a clean production environment.

### Q: How do I access the plugin documentation?
**A:** Click the **"Read Me"** link in:
- The plugin listings page (Plugins ‚Üí Installed Plugins)
- The FAQ admin menu (FAQs ‚Üí Read Me)

The built-in viewer renders the README.md file with proper formatting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Admin

### Q: Where is the FAQ ID displayed?
**A:** When you create or edit an FAQ, the plugin displays the FAQ ID directly below the title field in the editor. This makes it easy to know which ID to use in your shortcodes.

### Q: I see a notice about legacy database records. What should I do?
**A:** If you had an older version of the plugin that used a custom database table, the plugin will detect leftover records and alert you in WP Admin. You can safely ignore this if you're not experiencing issues, or contact support for help cleaning up old data.

### Q: Where can I find all my FAQs quickly?
**A:** On the **Plugins** page, click the "All FAQs" link under this plugin. It takes you directly to your FAQ listing screen in WP Admin.

### Q: Can I see which categories my FAQs belong to in the admin?
**A:** Yes! Version 1.04.5 added a category column in the admin listing, making it easy to see how your FAQs are organized.

### Q: Is there an edit option on the front end?
**A:** Yes, if you're logged in as an administrator, version 1.04.5+ shows an edit icon on the front end for quick access to FAQ editing.

### Q: I don't see the sitemap settings metabox. What's wrong?
**A:** The sitemap settings metabox only appears when editing FAQ posts (post type: `kiss_faq`). If you're editing a regular post or page, you won't see it. Also, run the self-tests in FAQ Settings to diagnose any registration issues.

### Q: My FAQ still appears in the sitemap even though I set it to "No." Why?
**A:** Check these possibilities:
1. **Global Setting:** If "Publish All FAQ Posts to Sitemap" is unchecked in FAQ Settings, it overrides individual settings
2. **Caching:** Your sitemap might be cached. Try visiting `/wp-sitemap-posts-kiss_faq-1.xml` directly
3. **SEO Plugin:** Some SEO plugins override WordPress's native sitemap functionality

### Q: How can I verify the noindex tag is working?
**A:**
1. Visit an FAQ post that's excluded from the sitemap
2. View the page source (right-click ‚Üí View Source)
3. Look for `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />` in the `<head>` section
4. Use the self-tests in FAQ Settings for automated verification

### Q: Can I bulk change sitemap settings for multiple FAQs?
**A:** Currently, you need to edit each FAQ individually to change its sitemap setting. However, you can use the global setting to exclude all FAQs at once, or use the cleanup tool to remove test posts in bulk.
